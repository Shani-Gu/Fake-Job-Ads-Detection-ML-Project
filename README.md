# 🧠 Fake Job Ads Detection using Machine Learning

**Goal:** Build a predictive model to detect fraudulent job ads based on text and metadata.

This project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning — from data exploration and cleaning to model training and evaluation — using real-world job postings.  
It highlights skills in **Python, data preprocessing, feature engineering, supervised learning, and model tuning**.

### 🧩 Key Outcomes
- Improved fraud detection accuracy to **94%** using an Artificial Neural Network (MLPClassifier).
- Identified **text-based patterns** (e.g., short company descriptions, missing logos, vague benefits) as key indicators of fake ads.
- Implemented data balancing, feature extraction, and hyperparameter optimization to improve model performance.
- Compared multiple models — **Decision Tree, ANN, and SVM** — and analyzed feature importance across approaches.

### 🚀 Project Value
This project mimics a **real-world data science task**:  
identifying fraudulent behavior through pattern recognition in text and categorical data.  
It showcases my ability to turn **raw, messy data** into a **predictive ML system** with strong results.
